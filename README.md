# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
End-to-end machine learning project for classifying Iris flower species using supervised learning algorithms, with model comparison and performance evaluation..

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to classify Iris flowers into three species—**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**—based on their morphological features. The objective is to compare model performance and identify the most accurate classifier.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and comparison.
